# ðŸš² BikeShare Insights Dashboard

**Company:** MetroCycle Co. â€“ a growing urban bike-share operator seeking to optimize usage and profitability.

## 1. **Problem Statement**
MetroCycle Co. lacked clear visibility into ride demand timing, subscriber behavior, and seasonal usage patterns. This resulted in:
- Inefficient bike distribution leading to empty or full stations during peak hours  
- Missed revenue opportunities due to poorly timed pricing and promotions  
- Inadequate marketing strategies failing to convert casual riders to subscribers

---

## 2. **Project Overview**
- Faced inefficiencies in bike availability and underutilized revenue windows at MetroCycle Co. due to a lack of insight into rider behavior, peak usage hours, and seasonal demand patterns.
- Performed data analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI to examine 34,000+ rides, identify high-revenue hours, seasonal trends, and segment revenue by registered vs. casual riders.
- Enabled strategic decision-making that optimized bike redistribution, supported summer-based marketing campaigns, and guided subscriber-focused growth.
